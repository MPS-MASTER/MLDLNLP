#1  What is time series data??
Ans : When data is strongly corelated to itself, Means data should be periodic and todays 
      data is correlated to yesterday's data is periodicity is 24 hours

#2 Arima : Auto regressive integrated moving average
#3 P,D,Q

#P = Auto regressive = Lags of the standerised series(no of lag terms)
#Q = Moving Average = Lags of the forcast(No of lag terms)
#D = If serires is not stationary means its not periodic then we make it stationary using D,
 We want to seperate out long term pattern from short term pattern(No of times the raw observation is differenced)



yt= mu(constant) + (phi1*yt-1+.....+phip*yt-p) - (theta1*et-1-.....-thetaq*et-q)



# Adfuller test : It is used to check if dataset is stationary or not
 It gives p-value if that is less than .05 then data is stationary so d = 0 , we dont need differencing

# plot_pacf : plot to find P(Auto regression lag) degree of correlation

# plot_acf  : plot to find q(forcast lag)
